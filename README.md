- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sadsquidd
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning geospatial analysis and other satellite imagery analysis that could help me in my field of interest (Geoarchaeology)
      I am currently working as an Archaeologist in my country and doing my master's of Geology degree in our National University
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Google Earth Engine.
      I also plan to learn ArcGis and surveying
      Drone mapping
      Photogrammetry etc.

I am new to the world of coding and completely have no idea what how to write code. I thought of joining here to start my journey. Hope to learn a lot from here on out!
